# Wonko The Web Server

*"Wonko is what my mother called me when I was a kid and clumsy and knocked things over, and a web server is what I am!"*

Preforking + EventMachine + thread pool experiment.
Supports keep-alive and `async.callback`.
Is fast (as in, standard setup is faster than Thin).
Do not use in production.

Wrote this in a weak moment, late at night.
